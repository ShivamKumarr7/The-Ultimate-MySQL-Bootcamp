CRUD --> CRUD STANDS FOR 
CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE


Suppose we have a table called cats;


CREATE TABLE cats
(
cat_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
name VARCHAR(100),
breed VARCHAR(100),
age INT
);


Q1) How to see the data or content that we have in our tables ?
Ans --> SELECT * FROM <table_name> 
        Ex-> SELECT * FROM cats;
        
        This will give the details of all the columns that exist in our table.
        
        Its a general way of saying "Give me all the columns from the table".
        
        
Q2) Can we select or see only the column we wish to see instead of seeing the whole table everytime ?
Ans --> Yus,we can see a particular column from a table.
        Ex-> SELECT name FROM cats;
             OR
             SELECT age FROM cats;
             OR
             SELECT breed FROM cats;
             OR
             SELECT cat_id FROM cats;
             
             We can even see 2 or more columns at once if we name it and use the proper syntax.
             Ex-> SELECT name,age FROM cats;
                  OR
                  SELECT cat_id,breed FROM cats;
                  OR
                  SELECT name,age,breed FROM cats;
                  
                  
Q3) THE "WHERE" clause ?
Ans-> We use WHERE to limit down the number of rows.
      Ex-> SELECT * FROM cats WHERE age = 4;
           OR
           SELECT name,age FROM cats WHERE age = 4;
           
           
Q4) "ALIAS"
Ans-> We can use "AS" in SQL to temporarily change the name of a column.
      Ex-> SELECT cat_id AS id FROM cats;
           OR
           SELECT cat_id AS id,name AS cat_name,age AS cat_age FROM cats;
           
           
Q5) UPDATE in MySQL ?
Ans --->  UPDATE cats SET name = 'tommy' WHERE name = 'Tabby';
          OR
          UPDATE cats SET name = 'fatso',age = 5 WHERE name = 'bob';
          OR
          UPDATE cats SET age = 14 WHERE name = 'Tabby';
          
          
Q6) DELETE in MySQL ?
Ans --> TO delete a row in MySQL we can use the below syntax 
        DELETE FROM <table_name>;   // this will delete all the rows of the table but the table will still exist but will have no data
        DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE age = 4;  // this will delete all the rows where age = 4;
        
        Ex-> DELETE FROM cats;
             OR
             DELETE FROM cats WHERE age = 4;
             OR
             DELETE FROM cats WHERE age = cat_id;
